# HelthCare Hospital Management System

## SE methodology/methods
### V shape
### Description
- It is an extension of the waterfall model, and instead of going down in a linear way, the process steps are
bent upwards after the implementation and coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The major difference
between the v-shaped model and waterfall models is the early test planning in the V-shaped model.
Reason for used that model
- we can use v shape model when we clearly defined and known software requirements, software
development technologies and tools. this method is simple and easy to use and each phase has specific
deliverables. In v shape model has higher chance to success over the waterfall model due to the development
of test plans early on during the life cycle. Therefore, we use v shape model.

## Requirements analysis
- As the goal of the application is ease of use and to provide an interactive service, extensive research has
been done to gain an insight into the needs and behaviours of various users. In online web-based Health
Care systems there are four parties who interact with the system, they are Admin, User (Patient) who wants
to have the service, the Hospitals and the Doctors. A good web based online Healthcare system should
present the following factors to the customers for better usability
### Customer requirements:
- Knowing when book a correct Doctor and time
- Select the Hospital where patient want to meet the doctor.
- Confirm the payment has done correctly.
